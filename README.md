# Battleship Game

This is a basic battleship game made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It has drag-and-drop functionality for users to place
their ships, and users battle with an AI to win. I built this project to gain a deeper understanding of 
Javascript promises, event listeners, and animations, as well as give me a practical introduction to using Jest. The hardest part was definitely the drag and drop functionality, with
building the AI being a close second. I'd like to polish the AI even more, and potentially add multiplayer.

## Getting started

Access the site at: https://cjkhaled.github.io/battleship-game/

You should then see the welcome screen. From there type in a valid name.

You should then see the plan screen. You can either place ships randomly with the specified button, or you can drag them
onto the board. Use the top axis buttons to change whether you want the ships to be placed vertically or horizontally. You 
can always reset if you don't like the placement you chose.

You should then reach the game screen. There is an optional cheat button if you'd like to see the computer's ships.
Click any spot on the computer's board to start the game, and from then on it is just battleship rules.
